* A `field-programmable gate array` (FPGA) is `an integrated circuit` designed to be `configured` by a customer or a designer `after manufacturing` â€“ hence the term "field-programmable".[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)

* The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a `hardware description language` (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)

# Programmable Logic Devices (PLD)

## Programmable Array Logic (PALs)

* Any logic equation can be realized in a two-level `sum of product` format. This is the key concept for PLDs.
* PAL has one fixed logic(OR/AND) plane(set of gates) and one programmable logic(AND/OR) plane. If AND fixed then OR programmable and vice versa.
* `OR fixed` and `AND programmable` configuration is more efficient than the other.
* Notation used to illustrate PAL architecture: Depend on the mark on the cross of two paths.
1. Dot : Hard wired
2. Cross : Programmable Link
3. None : Not Connected

## Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs)

* `CPLDs`- are devices with `multiple PALs` in the same package with `registered outputs` and an `interconnecting programmable fabric`.[Refer](https://www.altera.com/solutions/technology/system-design/articles/_2013/in-thebeginning.tablet.html f)

## Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
[Reference](https://www.altera.com/products/fpga/new-to-fpgas/resourcecenter/learn.tablet.html)

FPGAs consist of only 3 elements:
1. Routing wires
2. Logic gates
3. Register, or flip-flops.

The chip is made of an array of gates and flipflops with wires that can connect them together in patterns. These patterns create the logic for larger functions, like counters, timers, state machines, ALUs, and even whole CPUs. Creating the interconnecting pattern is the heart of FPGA design.

## System on a chip or system on chip (SoC or SOC)
* An integrated circuit (IC) that integrates all components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip. In other words an IC consists of multiple types of electronic components(GPUs, Communication interfaces,..) along with a Central Processing Unit(CPU)
* If it includes programmable logic, then it is a `Programmable SoC`, or `SoC FPGA`.
