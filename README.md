# Digital-Designs-with-FPGA

## Process of digital system designing
* Making a conceptual idea of the logical system to be built.
* Define a set of constraints that the final design should have.
* Choosing a set of primitive components from which the design is implemented.(This can be achieved by sub-dividing the design until the most primitive components are revealed.)

## Hardware Description Languages (HDLs)

Hardware Description Languages are used to describe digital systems.
